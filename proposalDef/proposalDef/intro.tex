        \noindent
		In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made significant strides, particularly in the development of word embeddings that capture both semantic and syntactic meanings of words. This proposal focuses on creating word embeddings for the Nepali language, which remains underrepresented in the realm of NLP due to its complex grammatical structure and rich character set. Despite the progress in NLP, low-resource languages like Nepali face challenges in data collection and model training. This study aims to address these challenges by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them with a substantial Nepali corpus. The proposed system will utilize transformer-based models, such as BERT, to generate contextualized word embeddings that can be applied to various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. By advancing NLP technologies for the Nepali language, we aim to enhance digital accessibility and empower communities through improved communication and educational tools.
