\chapter{Expected Outcome}
\noindent
The primary outcome of this project is to develop high-quality word embeddings for the Nepali language using transformer-based models like BERT. By achieving this, the project aims to significantly enhance the NLP capabilities for the Nepali language, improving the performance of various tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. One of the key outcomes will be the generation of contextualized word embeddings that accurately capture the semantic and syntactic nuances of words within their specific contexts, leading to more meaningful representations of the Nepali language.
